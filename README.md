- 👋 Hi, I’m @tom-harke-intel
- 👀 I’m interested in reducing the amount of continuous obsolescence at my day job
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: how disruptive it is that we are forced to change toolsets every few years (nomatter how good the current tools are), how disruptive it is to have a major team reorg every year having new upper management declare the previous management's toolset is obsolete.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making tools resist our culture of continuous obsolescence
- 📫 How to reach me ... if you can't figure it out, don't bother
